There's a new version of my [Zenphoto Sitemap](/projects/zenphoto-sitemap/) available, which only includes one fix this time.

The change makes the plugin handle non-alphanumeric characters correctly, such as whitespaces, parentheses, brackets, international letters, etc. All those characters are now URL encoded when the sitemap is generated.

As always you can get the new version at the [Zenphoto Sitemap](/projects/zenphoto-sitemap/) page.
