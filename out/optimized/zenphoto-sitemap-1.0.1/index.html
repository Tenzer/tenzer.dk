This causes the browser to interpret the sitemap correctly, and will probably also help out with search engines which may require this. Thanks goes to Adrien Gibrat who suggested this.</p><p>You can see the updated sitemap in action on my gallery, and if you just want to download the new version, then go to the <a href=/projects/zenphoto-sitemap/ >Zenphoto Sitemap</a> page.</p></div></div><footer>Copyright Â© 2020 <a href=https://twitter.com/Tenzer>Jeppe Fihl-Pearson</a> unless otherwise noted.</footer></body></html>
