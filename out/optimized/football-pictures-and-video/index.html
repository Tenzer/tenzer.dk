They can all be found in the <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/tenzer/sets/72157627619086069/ >Flickr gallery</a> for the game.</p><p>Tuesday this week <a href=http://jens-k.dk/ >Jens Rørbye</a> - the media manager for Copenhagen Towers - contacted me and asked if I could help out with an interview of the teams American import quarterback player, JR Artozqui. <a href=http://copenhagen-towers.dk/senior-elite/news/273-qb-jr-artozqui-signs-on-for-2012>The news</a> was that the player has renewed his contract for another season, so the interview was about that and living in Copenhagen.</p><p>The interview was recorded Wednesday and ended up being 20 minutes long. I spent my entire Wednesday and Thursday evenings on getting the interview edited. It was mostly a matter of getting the sound to be clear to make it easier to hear what the guys were saying. A bit of color correction was also required since the interview was shot on a grey day without much light, and without any artificial lighting. You can see the interview on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSNsvMz4oD4&amp;cc_load_policy=1">YouTube</a>.</p><p>I have to say I am pretty satisfied with the finished product, and I've only received good responses from other members of the club. Especially when you consider the equipment we had available for the interview:</p><ul><li>Canon 550D DSLR camera</li><li>Sigma 50mm f/1.4 lens</li><li>Hama tripod</li><li>Two microphones</li></ul><p>Apart from one of the microphones, I have all the above equipment. It was really a basic setup, but we could have used some extra light, for instance in the form of a reflector. Also, I need to be better in the future to see things which aren't working out that good on camera while shooting. For instance, in the first part of the interview, JR is standing more or less with his back towards the camera, this worked out much better when shooting the second part of the interview by the water.</p><p>Today I am going to the national championship finals in American football, where I will have press access to the sideline of the field in order to take pictures of the Copenhagen Towers' U16 and U19 teams who both have qualified for the finals. Unfortunately the senior team I play on didn't make it pass the semi-final. I have rented a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens for the event today in the hope that it will make it possible for me to get slightly better shots than I usually have.</p></div></div><footer>Copyright © 2020 <a href=https://twitter.com/Tenzer>Jeppe Fihl-Pearson</a> unless otherwise noted.</footer></body></html>
