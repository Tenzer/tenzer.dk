I've made a new design for my website and in the process also switched it from being based on Wordpress to now being a static site.</p><p>Back in July my colleague <a href=http://cknv.dk/ >Esben</a> started work on his own static site generator, <a href=https://github.com/cknv/beetle>Beetle</a>, and I got interested in the project shortly after. Within a month I made the first pull request to Beetle while also acting as a sparring partner to Esben's development work.</p><p>For a while I had an urge to do something about my website which was more or less desserted for the last couple of years. The only thing I did with it was to update the Wordpress installation every few months due to new security issues being found in the project. So instead I thought that I would redo it all as a static site, with a new fresh, mobile and retina friendly, easy readable design, and I hope that also would help spark my urge to blog some more again (I have yet to prove that).</p><p>For inspiration of how the site could look and what content I should include, I looked at some of my friends' websites (<a href=http://cknv.dk/ >cknv.dk</a>, <a href=https://mntr.dk/ >mntr.dk</a>, <a href=https://kenneth.io/ >kenneth.io</a>) and found a <a href=https://color.adobe.com/Flat-UI-color-theme-2469224/ >color scheme</a> and a simple <a href=http://fastr-demo.themes.kanishkkunal.in/ >Wordpress theme</a> that I liked which I could base my own site upon.</p><p>I worked on the site on and off over the following months, finding bugs and limitations in Beetle that was solved along with Esben, and I also made a few plugins for Beetle that I needed (a <a href=https://github.com/Tenzer/beetle-sass>SASS compiler</a>, <a href=https://github.com/Tenzer/beetle-htmlmin>HTML minifier</a> and a <a href=https://github.com/Tenzer/beetle-sitemap>sitemap.xml generator</a>).</p><p>Then on christmas eve, moments before the family dinner was about to start, I switched my website to point to this new wonder and announced it on <a href=https://twitter.com/Tenzer/status/547800770742337536>Twitter</a>. It didn't cause as much of a uproar as I expected, probably due to my timing, but I'm at least satisfied with what I have produced.</p><p>I have a few topics in mind going forward that I want to blog about, mostly operations/devops related stuff, such as:</p><ul><li>My new HP Microserver at home, running <a href=https://smartos.org/ >SmartOS</a></li><li>Amazon Web Services related posts, ie. about the new <a href=https://github.com/boto/boto3>Boto3 Python library</a> for working with the API</li><li>Tips and configuration examples for the <a href=http://nginx.org/ >Nginx</a> webserver</li><li>Recommendations and guides for how to monitor your applications and set up monitoring systems.</li></ul><p>But I don't want to limit myself to only those subjects, so don't be surprised if other topics pop up here.</p><p>If there's something you think I should talk about first, some topics that I missed or just some general feedback on the site, feel free to contact me on Twitter at <a href=https://twitter.com/Tenzer>@Tenzer</a> or make a pull request on the <a href=https://github.com/Tenzer/tenzer.dk>repository</a> for the site.</p></div></div><footer>Copyright Â© 2020 <a href=https://twitter.com/Tenzer>Jeppe Fihl-Pearson</a> unless otherwise noted.</footer></body></html>
