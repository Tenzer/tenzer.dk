I had listened to both artists a fair bit prior to the concert, and the concert was free so it was really a no brainer to go.</p><p>I decided to try and take some pictures from the concerts in order to get some more experience in shooting low light photography, so the day of the concert I went out and rented a <a href=http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Standard_and_Medium_Telephoto/EF_50mm_f1.4_USM/ >Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens</a> which would fit onto my <a href=http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_550D/ >Canon EOS 550D (Rebel T2i) camera</a>. I tested out the lens a bit prior to the concerts, and found it to not be that sharp when using the wide open apertures. I have also found reviews of the lens which state the same thing, and suggested stopping down to f/2.8 where it can deliver very sharp images. The lens was however much better for the purpose than any alternative I owned, since it either would have to be my <a href=http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/EF-S/EF-S_18-55mm_f3.5-5.6_IS_II/ >Canon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens</a> or the <a href=http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Macro/EF_100mm_f2.8_Macro_USM/ >Canon 100mm f/2.8 USM</a> which would have too much zoom and not a wide enough aperture.</p><p>So I went to the concert, and I am very satisfied with the results I got out of it, considering it was my first time doing concert photography in the dark. But you can judge for yourself in the <a href=https://www.flickr.com/photos/tenzer/sets/72157627485926578/ >Flickr set</a>.</p><p>For my next concert set I hope to have gotten my hands on a <a href=http://www.sigmaphoto.com/product/50mm-f14-ex-dg-hsm>Sigma 50mm f/1.4 HSM lens</a> which should be sharper wide open, which is really what you need for the low light shots, and be better built.</p></div></div><footer>Copyright © 2016 <a href=https://twitter.com/Tenzer>Jeppe Toustrup</a> unless otherwise noted.</footer></body></html>
